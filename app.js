// Plan // 

//1. Create functions for basic operators 
    // add
    // subtract
    // multiply
    // divide
//1.1 test in browser console

//2. Create variables for 3 sections of an operation
//      variable a - first number
//      variable b - operator
//      variable c - second number

// 3. Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers 
//      and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.
// 
// 4. Create calculator GUI in HTML
//      4.1 Don't worry about it looking good
//      4.2 Just make sure it works and can be customized later
//      4.3 Make sure current operation is displayed correctly
//      4.4 Add clear button
// 5. Make the calculator work! 
//      5.1 You’ll need to store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user 
//          presses an operator, and also save which operation has been chosen and then operate() 
//          on them when the user presses the “=” key.
//      5.2 You should already have the code that can populate the display, so once operate() has been called, 
//          update the display with the ‘solution’ to the operation.
//      5.3
